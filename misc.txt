put in a few preys
and a few predators

predators and preys move randomly 
one block immediately to the surrounding (decide if u want to include diagonals)
predator eats the prey if it moves onto it

prey does not move if all of its surrounding squares are occupied
assign random animals at random
pick animal at random and move it at random

if a prey survives for 3 moves it will reproduce
child will appear at random on surrounding cells
if the cells are occupied it will not breed
